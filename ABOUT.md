What is Cropdet?
-----------------
*Help! I have a million images and I'm sure there are some documents with unwanted cropping errors on scans, but which are they?*

Checking to identify cropping errors on scan manually is a very time-consuming and error-prone process. You need a tool to help you: Cropdet.

Cropdet is an open source tool which:

* provides decision-making support for cropping error on scans detection in or across collections
* identifies cropping errors even independent from file format, scan quality, sizes, direction, shape, colour and lighting conditions 
* applies state-of-the art image processing  
* is useful in assembling collections from multiple sources, and identifying corrupted files

What Can Cropdet Do For Me?

Cropdet brings the following benefits:

* Automated quality assurance
* Reduced manual effort and error
* Saved time
* Lower costs, e.g. storage, effort
* Open source, standalone tool. Also as Taverna component for easy invocation
